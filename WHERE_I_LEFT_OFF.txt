Did:

To Do:
1. Plot the population distributions, matplotlib
2. Compare with either python or R p-value calculators
3. Now do in context of Cohen's d
4. Write up latex description of this program.
5. Make plots - check that hist is acutally normalized .... Needs fixed.
6. compare t-scores from both methods


Talked with Bill:
1. Talked to Bill, t-distribution is normal only when N-> large,
   For looking at N=3,5,10,20, should be very careful about computing
   frac_w_t_gt_2.  This corrects for the fact that at low N.  When N is small
   my p-value is wrong! Need to adjust for critical errors.
   --> He says 'more often than not' biomedical researcher does the right thing!
   --> 'unpaired' two sample t-test, '2-sample-independent' t-test.
   --> look up pt and qt
   --> FIXED!!
2. Suggested plotting 't' and comparing to normal
3. My stdev of mean intuition is correct.

Question:
1. Ask Bill if my random trials are now correct, now that I'm using the correct t-score?
