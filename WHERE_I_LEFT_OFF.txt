Did:

To Do:
1. Plot the population distributions, matplotlib
2. Compute p-value
3. Do experiments as a function of number of samples in groups
4. Test distribution with exact overlap.
5. Compare with either python or R p-value calculators
6. Finish welchs_t_test(), ask on SO what to do with degrees of freedom
7. Do better integration of gamma() that handles Z < 1.0 correctly, right now Z=0.5
   returns an incorrect value.

Talked with Bill:
1. Talked to Bill, t-distribution is normal only when N-> large,
   For looking at N=3,5,10,20, should be very careful about computing
   frac_w_t_gt_2.  This corrects for the fact that at low N.  When N is small
   my p-value is wrong! Need to adjust for critical errors.
   --> He says 'more often than not' biomedical researcher does the right thing!
   --> 'unpaired' two sample t-test, '2-sample-independent' t-test.
   --> look up pt and qt
2. Suggested plotting 't' and comparing to normal
3. My stdev of mean intuition is correct.
