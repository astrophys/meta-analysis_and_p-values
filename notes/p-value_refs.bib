    abstract = {A new approach is presented for the meta-analysis of data from pre-test-post-test designs. With this approach, data from studies using different designs may be compared directly and studies without control groups need not be omitted. The approach is based on a ‘standardized mean-change’ measure, computed for each sample within a study, and involves analysis of the standardized mean changes and differences in the standardized mean changes. Analyses are illustrated using results of studies of the effectiveness of mental practice on motor-skill development.},
