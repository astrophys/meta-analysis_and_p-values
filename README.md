# Meta-analysis and p-values
## Purpose
I recently became interested in meta-analysis after reading the [Smith and Iadarola 2015][https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15374416.2015.1077448].
In their paper they compare a variety of papers and used Cohen's 'd' as the metric for their analsysis.  
They utilize 95% confidence intervals, but fail to describe how they compute either Cohen's 'd' or the confidence intervals.
They state "When possible, we present results in terms of effect size (Cohen’s d) and 95% confidence intervals, as reported by the investigators or derived from Wilson’s (n.d.) effect size calculator, which uses formulas presented by [Lipsey and Wilson (2001)][https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16602-000]"
This is a very unsatisfying description of their work and they should provide the formula from which they work.  

[Smith and Iadarola 2015][https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15374416.2015.1077448]'s confidence intervals aren't necessarily symetric, which is confusing because on p114 of [Lipsey and Wilson (2001)][https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16602-000] they describe computing the confidence interval utilizing the critical value of the z-distribution and simply doing `mean effect size +/- z_crit_value`.
Using [Lipsey and Wilson (2001)][https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2000-16602-000] formulation of the confidence interval, it should be symmetric about the mean.
It is not obvious from their
